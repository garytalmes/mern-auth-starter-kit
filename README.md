# MERN Auth Starter Kit

The latest version of my MERN Auth Starter Kit for use by my students.

It features:

- An Express back end with Mongo/Mongoose database.
- Modern React front-end, built with Vite, using React Context for storage of global user state.
- Some Bootstrap integration to tidy things up a bit.

## Instructions

- Clone the repo
- Create a .env file in the server folder (see env.example)
- Run `npm install`
- For development, run `npm run develop` from the project root.
